Note:  Both Debug and Release configurations should properly compile 
and execute.  Release might require some ASM compiler.  The following
instructions should work for version 7 or higher of MSVC (just convert the
projects to the new format when prompted)

Instructions to get MSVC compiling to work:

- Download zlib-1.2.3:
http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz
	
 - Download libevent-1.3e:
http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent-1.3e.tar.gz

 - Extract both packages to the contrib directory
 
 - Download OpenSSL-0.9.8g:
http://www.slproweb.com/download/Win32OpenSSL-0_9_8g.exe

 - Install OpenSSL-0.9.8g  (let it keep the default path, C:\OpenSSL)

 - I did this using Cygwin.  Feel free to try using patch for windows as well:
cd contrib/zlib-1.2.3
patch -p 1 -i ../../Win32Build/vc7/zlib-1.2.3.patch
cd ../libevent-1.3e
patch -p 1 -i ../../Win32Build/vc7/libevent-1.3e.patch

 - Open Win32Build/vc7/Tor/Tor.sln and compile all projects
